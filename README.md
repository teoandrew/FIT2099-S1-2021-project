### Project Scope

The scope of the project is to create a Dinosaur Park, with multiple dinosaur objects, item objects (i.e. trees, vending machines) and a Player object.

The dinosaurs have many behaviours. They are free to roam around the map, eat plants, attacking one another depending on their respective behaviours, and even eat one another.

Dinosaurs and players can interact with items such as trees, with herbivorous dinosaurs eating the leaves or fruits from the tree and players picking fruits from the trees. Other items such as the vending machine can be used by the player only to buy fruits or weapons.

The player is also free to roam around the map and interact with almost every single object in the Dinosaur Park.

### Purpose of Project

This project focused on students being able to apply Object Oriented Design and Principles such as the SOLID principles, proper abstraction and encapsulation, good practices for refactoring, getting rid and preventing code smells, and other design techniques like dependency injection for instance.

There was also an emphasis on familiarising students with the Unified Modeling Language (UML) through UML Diagram creations such as a class diagram and multiple sequence diagrams for the system of the project.
